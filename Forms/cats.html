Having a cat can mean different things to different people. Some want a cat to cuddle and sit on their laps;
others are happy to live with a very independent cat which spends most of its time outside and doesn’t
want too much human interaction. What is important is that you try to find a cat that will interact with you if you want it to.
All cats are not the same and how each individual cat behaves with you can depend on its inherent personality and early experiences (or lack of experiences),
which can make it fearful or confident
with people and life in general. The environment in which you keep a cat is also extremely significant – for example if it lives with many other cats which do not get
on, then it will be stressed and will react differently than if
it was on its own. While there is no guaranteed way to choose the perfect cat for you and your lifestyle, understanding your expectations as well as
what makes cats tick will help you to bring home a cat that should be able to cope with its new environment and be the pet that you want too.

How much care and attention does a cat need?
As pets go, cats are relatively low maintenance compared to dogs which need companionship, walking, training etc. However, like any pet, they do need care, and some cats need more care than others. Do you want to spend a lot of time with your cat, do you want it to be demanding, or do you have limited time? Cats can fit into busy, modern lifestyles more easily than dogs, as they are pretty independent, can be left alone much more easily and are more suitable for smaller flats or houses. Cats are often chosen by people who have busy and stressful lifestyles and who want some companionship when they go home to relax.
What do you want from your relationship with a cat? If you’re the kind of person who really needs to have a close relationship with your cat and to be able to handle it and have it interact with you, then you’ll be disappointed if you take on a nervous cat that hides every time you come into the room. You may want to think about one of the pedigree breeds which can be more interactive and perhaps more needy of human company than some moggies. This may however become a problem for the cat if you are out at work all day and only available to give attention on evenings or weekends.
Some cats need to know exactly what’s going to happen when, in order to feel relaxed. Such cats would be quite happy living with an old lady who rarely has visitors and leads a very quiet life, but would probably find it quite stressful living in a home full of kids and other animals with lots of visitors and activity. Other cats, however, might thrive on different interactions with lots of people and fit in perfectly well in a busy household.
If you’re not likely to have the time or inclination to groom a cat on a daily basis, don’t even think of getting a Persian or a cat with a long coat. In pedigree jargon, any cat with a longer coat, aside from a Persian, is called semi-longhaired because the coat is not as full as the Persian’s and does not have such a thick undercoat; however, it is still long and requires grooming. In addition, if you are extremely house-proud, you may not want lots of hair everywhere.
A shorthaired cat is a much easier option, as most cats are fanatical about their coats and keep them in immaculate condition. That’s not to say that they don’t leave hairs around – bear this in mind if you’re thinking of getting a white cat but have dark furniture, or vice versa. Likewise, a cat is quite likely to sharpen its claws indoors, often on the stair carpet, sometimes on the furniture or even on the wallpaper. Whether your cat does this can depend on the cat itself and also the environment you provide for it; however there are things you can do to try and deal with this, but it is best to acknowledge from the outset that your cat is an animal with free will and natural behaviour that may not suit someone who needs to have an immaculate house.

        Oftentimes people hear the words "cat training" and think there's no way they'd be able to train their cat. The truth is that cats CAN be trained, and it's quite easy to get started. Some might say it's even easier than training dogs!
      Whether you're looking to correct problem behavior, teach some obedience skills, or train your cat to learn fun tricks, cat training is an enriching, rewarding, and fun activity the two of you can enjoy together.

      Reasons Why Cat Training is Important
      Contrary to popular belief, cats do require mental and physical enrichment. If not given proper stimulation, cats can become bored, which then leads to problems such as destructive behavior, weight gain, depression, and other health issues. Training requires your cat to problem solve while also increasing their movement, which makes it an excellent form of both mental and physical exercise.
      Training with your cat will alsohelp to strengthen the bond the two of you share. It gives you a fun activity to do together, and it builds trust. As you work with your cat, you'll get a deeper understanding of their personality, their body language, and how their mind works. This understanding will build a closer relationship and be helpful in other areas of your cat's life as well.
      Last but not least, training your cat can eliminate undesirable or problem behaviors. As mentioned, bored cats can become destructive, so if this is something your cat struggles with, training can help! You can also use clicker training to correct problem behavior such as unwanted scratching, biting, and counter surfing.

      While it is easy to get started clicker training with your cat, there is a little bit of prep work to do first!

      The training possibilities with your cat are endless. This means you'll never run out of things to do, but it also means it can be a bit overwhelming at first. With so many options of behaviors to work on, where do you start?
      To help keep you and your kitty on track right from the beginning, it's important to decide what kind of behaviors you'd like to start with. What are your goals? Are you wanting to fix an unwanted behavior, work on practical skills, or learn fun tricks? Making this choice doesn't mean you can't expand into other areas eventually. It just gives you a solid starting point and prevents you from trying to go in too many directions too soon.
      9 Cat Training Tips
      Alright, so you've gotten the recommended tools and materials and you've chosen your training path. It's time to get started!
      1. Start with something easy.
      As with anything new, it's important to start with the basics first. As tempting as it may be to jump right into training your cat to jump through a hoop, chances are that would end in frustration for both of you. Start with some simple skills to show your cat that training is fun and easy.
      Teaching your cat that the "click" means they get a treat is the first step of clicker training. Once your cat understands the click, you may want to try teaching them to sit. Target training is also a good, beginner skill. By starting with these foundation skills, you will be well prepared to progress onto more advanced behaviors.
      2. Keep the training sessions short.
      It can be hard to keep a cat's attention when they are new to training. Shorter sessions will keep your cat focused, and prevent them from losing interest or getting frustrated.
      When your cat is first beginning, we recommend starting with 3-5 minute sessions once or twice a day. Short but frequent and consistent training sessions will be way more effective than longer ones. For example, having two to three 5 minute training sessions in a day is typically better than one 15 minute session.
      As your cat advances, you can increase the length of your training sessions. If possible, try to end your session on a positive note before your cat loses interest.
      3. Eliminate any distractions.
      Pick a quiet area of your home for your cat training sessions – someplace with as few distractions as possible. Family members, other pets, and noises can be quite distracting, and your cat may not be able to focus.
      If you have other pets, close them off in another room of the house so you and your cat can focus only on each other and the training. While there are strategies to train multiple cats at once, it's best to start off working with just one cat at a time.
      4. Reward immediately and consistently.
      The clicker takes a snaphshot of the correct behavior and let's your cat know which behavior earned the reward. For clicker training to work properly, it's essential to click right at the precise moment your cat performs the desired behavior. Because the click is a promise of a reward, it's necessary always to give your cat a treat after you click. Behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated, so once your cat knows what behavior is earning treats, they will start to offer that behavior making it easy for you to add a signal down the road.

      5. Find the right reward.
      There is no magical, universal training treat. Just as with humans, different cats have different treat preferences. Some may prefer dry treats or kibble, while others prefer wet food or squeezable treats. It's good to have multiple treats that your cat will work for.
      You may also find that your cat is willing to perform easy behaviors for one type of treat, but that they require a higher-value treat for more difficult behaviors. A high value treat doesn't necessarily mean a more expensive treat. It is just a treat your cat sees as being special.
      Again, this will be different for every cat, but typically it will be something they don't get to have on a very regular basis. For example, if your cat only eats wet food for their regular meals, they may see dry food as something extra special!
      6. Don't punish the bad behavior.
      As a general rule, cats don't respond well to punishment. Punishing your cat can lead to stress and anxiety, and it can damage the sense of trust you're building. Some cats will even view punishment as a reward - negative attention is attention, after all!
      Clicker training is all about positive reinforcement. The idea is always to reward the desired behaviors. When your cat engages in a negative behavior, you should try to redirect or distract your cat rather than punish. Better yet, figure out why your cat is doing that behavior and try to prevent it or teach them an alternative one. For example, if your cat is scratching the couch, the goal is to teach them to scratch a more appropriate option.
      7. Be consistent with your cues.
      To avoid confusion, always use the same voice commands and hand signals for the behavior you are working on. Be sure that anyone else who trains with your cat also knows the correct commands and signals.
      8. Train at the right time.Training requires a lot of focus from your cat, so you will want to be strategic about when you do your training sessions. After a nap or first thing in the morning is usually a good time, as your cat will be rested and ready for an activity. Right before mealtimes are great too because your cat will be more willing to work for their treat rewards if they're a bit hungry. If your cat tends to be active at bedtime, you can engage in a training session with them before you go to sleep to help tire them out too.
      9. Involve others
      If you have other members of your household, it is beneficial to include them in your cat's training process. This is especially important if you're working on training out any unwanted behaviors. All members of the household should know what the training method and goal is so they can also correctly and consistently address the bad behavior when it comes up.
      Involving others in the training also helps to build your cat's socialization skills.
      Obedience skills
      Obedience skills are a natural place to start. These include commands such as "sit," coming when called, "stay," "drop it," target training, eye contact, etc. Many of the basic obedience skills are used as building blocks for future skills.
      Target
      Target training involves teaching your cat to touch an object with a specific part of their body for a reward. For example, getting your cat to touch the end of a target stick with their nose.
      Using the target stick, you can:
      Have a clear signal to move your cat from one point to another
      Guide your cat willingly into a carrier or backpack
      Teach fun tricks such as jumping over your arms or legs
      Help a shy cat overcome their fear of strangers. You can use the target as an icebreaker with strangers by providing a constructive way to interact
      Tire your cat out before bed.
